Notes:
1) assuming resgiter is a seperate page, while sign in is done on the current page.
2) assuming dashboard is unreachable unless logged in, else will need to do some restful services to change how pages are rendered depending on if logged in || !
3) 


TODO:
1) need to change topleft mobi link when logged in to go to dashboard.html(logged in) instead of index.html(logged out)
2) handle log in (let parse handle it?), then change all signup links to log out links (simple jquery if statement?)
